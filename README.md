I am a young programmer who has been involved in the programming field for approximately 4 years, gradually learning to program in C#, Java, CSS, and HTML.

Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the university. I have completed the first semester and recently finished a project that is featured in my repositories.

One of my biggest projects so far has been a learning assistance program for programming called Synapses. This project demanded a lot of time and effort, and personally, I believe I did a good job.
